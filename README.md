## Hi hi, I'm Tahiyat! 👋

I am a passionate compsci student who loves to explore new tools and languages. Here are a few things about me:

- 💡 **Curious and Inquisitive**: I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. I'm willing to slog through data I enjoy, like sorting tags for hours.
- 💻 **Developer**: Proficient in multiple programming languages and always looking to expand my skill set.
- 🌟 **Inspired**: "Information is Beautiful" is motivating and makes me strive to present information in engaging and insightful ways.
- 🛼 **Persistent Learner**: Currently ungracefully learning to roller skate—I'm all about embracing new challenges, even if it means falling down a few times.
- 🎨 **Creative and Fun**: I love making funny edits and memes of my friends, bringing a bit of humor and creativity into everything I do.
